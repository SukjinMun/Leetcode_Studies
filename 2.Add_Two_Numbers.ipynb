    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "You're given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node of the linked list contains a single digit. Your task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- The number of nodes in each linked list is between 1 and 100.\n",
    "- The value of each node (digit) is between 0 and 9.\n",
    "- The input lists represent numbers without leading zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "1. **ListNode Definition:**\n",
    "   - A `ListNode` represents a single node in a linked list. It has two attributes:\n",
    "     - `val`: Represents the value of the node (digit).\n",
    "     - `next`: Represents the reference to the next node in the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **addTwoNumbers Function:**\n",
    "   - This function takes two linked lists, `l1` and `l2`, as inputs.\n",
    "   - It initializes a dummy node to act as the head of the resulting linked list and starts traversing both `l1` and `l2` simultaneously.\n",
    "   - While traversing, it performs digit-by-digit addition, considering the carry from the previous addition.\n",
    "   - The result of the addition is stored in a new linked list, and its head is returned as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Linked Lists:**\n",
    "   - Two example linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) are created to represent the numbers given in reverse order.\n",
    "   - Each digit of the number is stored in a separate node of the linked list, and nodes are connected together by assigning the `next` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calling addTwoNumbers Function:**\n",
    "   - The `addTwoNumbers` function is called with `l1` and `l2` as arguments to perform the addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Printing the Result:**\n",
    "   - The resulting linked list obtained from the addition is traversed, and its values are printed sequentially.\n",
    "   - Each value represents a digit in the resulting sum, and the digits are printed in reverse order to display the correct sum of the two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall objective is to add two numbers represented by linked lists by performing digit-wise addition, carrying over when necessary, and returning the resultant linked list representing the sum. The code demonstrates this addition and prints the resulting linked list representing the sum of the given numbers."

    "1. **`ListNode`**: Defines a class representing a node in a singly-linked list. Each node contains a value (`val`) and a reference to the next node (`next`).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **`dummy = ListNode(0)`**: Creates a dummy node to act as the head of the resulting linked list.\n",
